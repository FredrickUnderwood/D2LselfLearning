# My Deep-Learning Library

### 2023/10/22

I have learned deep-learning for almost 3 months based on my first commit to this repository on 7/21. Before this repo, I don't have any basis on deep-learning, even my first Python environment was installed in April. So I was a totally new guy to deep-learning as well as Python coding.

Thanks to Mu Li's [**DIVE INTO DEEP LEARNING**]([《动手学深度学习》 — 动手学深度学习 2.0.0 documentation (d2l.ai)](https://zh.d2l.ai/)) which provided me a very smooth start with deep-learning. I really recommended all of you to join this tutorial if you need to master coding in deep-learning in a very short time.

After watching most of his videos and understanding the code from him and his team, I started to take [Kaggle]([Kaggle: Your Home for Data Science](https://www.kaggle.com/)). In Kaggle, you can make your deep-learning knowledge into practice, as well as it provides free GPU resources.

| ./kaggle     | my code and for all the Kaggle competition I have taken      |
| ./D2L        | my code write based on D2L                                   |
| ./papers     | some classic papers and the reviews I write for them         |
| MyTrainer.py | The trainer I used by myself, which is able to fine-tune, cross-valid and saving the params. And I still work on it to solve some bugs maybe. |
